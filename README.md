### JSORTS
A repo for testing 3 basic java sorting algorithms

### TIME COMPLEXITY
#### Best 
Bubble is approx. equal to insertion, selection is slowest

#### Average
Bubble is slowest, selection is middle, insertion is fastest

#### Worst
All are O(n^2)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY
O(1)

### RUNNING CODE
- To compile, run `javac *.java`
- To run, run `java Main [SIZE OF ARRAY] [SORTED OR RANDOM] [TYPE OF SORT: INSERTION, SELECTION, OR BUBBLE]` (i.e. java Main 40000 sorted bubble)
